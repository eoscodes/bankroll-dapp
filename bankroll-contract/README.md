# Actions

## announceroll
### Parameters:

|----------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| name     | **creator**        | The account name of the creator of this roll. Needs to be the account calling this action                                                                |

### Decription:

This is the action to be called initially when creating a new roll. The bets can not be set within this action, but are rather set later by calling the accouncebet action.

## announcebet
### Parameters:

| Type     | Name        | Description                                                                              |

| uint64_t | **random_seed** | Seed that will be used in the randomness generation process                              |

### Description:

Adds a bet to an already created roll. Note that it is not yet paid for immediately. All bets of a roll are paid for at once when starting the roll later. Can only be called by the creator of the roll.

## payoutbet
### Parameters:

| Type     | Name       | Description                                                                                      |
|----------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| name     | **from**       | The account name that will receive the payout                                                    |
| asset    | **quantity**   | The amount of Wax to payout                                                                      |
| uint64_t | **irrelevant** | This parameter is not used within the action. It is required as a workaround for internal calls. |

### Description:

This is called as a deferred action by the bankroll contract when paying out bets. This is needed to ensure that if an individual payout fails, other payouts of the same roll are not affected. Because deferred actions are not guaranteed to execute, this action can also be called manually by anyone that has outstanding payouts (but not by anyone else).

## withdraw
### Parameters:

| Type     | Name               | Description                                                                                                       |
|----------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| name     | **from**               | The account name of the investor to withdraw from                                                                 |
| uint64_t | **weight_to_withdraw** | The bankroll_weight to withdraw. The Wax paid out will be `(weight_to_withdraw / total bankroll weight) * bankroll` |

### Decription:

Withdraws a part of the bankroll weight previously gained by investing. Can only be called by the investor account to withdraw from.

# Wax Transfers

Some actions are also triggered not by directly calling them, but rather by sending Wax to the contract with a special memo.
**The following memo formats are available:**

## memo: deposit
The sent Wax is added to the bankroll, and the sender receives the corresponding bankroll weight added onto his *investors* table entry.


## memo: startroll <creator_roll_id>
This is used to start a roll that has previously been announced. At least one bet has to have been announced as well. The amount of Wax sent needs to be equal to the sum of all bet amounts of this roll.
The internal bankroll management can reject starting the roll, if the risk for the bankroll is too high. In that case, the whole transfer fails and no Wax will be transferred.
