/**
 * This is a modified linked list.
 * This datastructure is used for relatively efficient insertion of elements in the middle.
 * By inserting bets in the first element, they are passed through the list, until they are inserted where appropiate.
 * If required, new ChainedRanges are automatically created and inserted in the middle of this ChainedRange
 * 
 * Note:
 * Using the new operator for creating ChainedRanges and not freeing them later is a memory leak.
 * However, the way eos works is to set up a new environment for every action and then purge it when the action is done
 * Therefore, the memory leak solves itself
