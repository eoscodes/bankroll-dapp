# Gambling Contract

The gambling contract provides developers and players an easy to use interface for the main [bankroll contract](https://github.com/PocketQuads/bankroll-dapp/tree/master/bankroll-contract).

You can find the backend scripts necessary to automatically start rolls in our [bankroll-scripts](https://github.com/pinknetworkx/bankroll-scripts) repository.
