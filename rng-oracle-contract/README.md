# RNG Oracle Contract

This RNG contract acts as a replacement until the official [WAX RNG Oracle](https://wax.io/blog/how-the-wax-rng-smart-contract-solves-common-problems-for-dapp-developers) goes live. It behaves very similarly to how the official contract will behave, in order to make it easy to migrate once the official oracle becomes available.

A more detailed documentation will soon be available.
