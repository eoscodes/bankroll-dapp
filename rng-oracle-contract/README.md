# RNG Oracle Contract

### Update: Our bankroll contract has now switched to the official WAX RNG Oracle. Therefore this contract is no longer in use.

This RNG contract acts as a replacement until the official [WAX RNG Oracle](https://wax.io/blog/how-the-wax-rng-smart-contract-solves-common-problems-for-dapp-developers) goes live. It behaves very similarly to how the official contract will behave, in order to make it easy to migrate once the official oracle becomes available.

You can find the backend scripts necessary to respond to oracle requests in our [bankroll-scripts](https://github.com/pinknetworkx/bankroll-scripts) repository.
